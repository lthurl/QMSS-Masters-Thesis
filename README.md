A Quasi-Summative Study on the effect of  COVID-19 on Mental Health in the USA

Slowly deciding what to upload to git...

Main Hypothesis:
  The data will show that Covid-19 has negatively affected self-reported rates of anxiety and/or 
depression, such that people report higher rates of anxiety and/or depression. More specifically,
anxiety and depression will have a negative relationship with economic security, food security, 
and health concerns. Secondly, the researcher expects to see results showing that the pandemic 
has had a negative impact on respondents who are Hispanic and, more specifically, that they
have been more negatively impacted by COVID-19 than respondents who are not Hispanic. 
Thirdly, the data will show that as education level increases, anxiety increases. Lastly, the data 
will show loss of employment or continued unemployment has negative relation with anxiety 
and depression. In order to falsify my hypothesis, the data must show no significant difference in 
reported rates of anxiety and depression as dictated by the groups of independent variables. In 
this case the null hypothesis would be accepted. However, there is the possibility that there will 
be insufficient data to draw a conclusion for either hypothesis and in which case no significant 
difference can be supported and further studies on the matter will be suggested.

Data from:
  U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey
